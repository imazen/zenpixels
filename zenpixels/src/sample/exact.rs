/// Proven exact code depth of the current samples of a canonical U8/U16 image.
///
/// `color_bits = N` states that every current color sample `v` survives
/// re-quantization to N-bit codes: narrowing it to N bits and widening back to
/// the storage depth reproduces `v` exactly, using the canonical rule for the
/// signal range (nearest full-scale rescaling for full range; power-of-two
/// anchor scaling for narrow range). `alpha_bits` states the same for alpha,
/// which is always full scale. Storage depth itself is always exact, so the
/// weakest evidence is `color_bits == alpha_bits == storage bits`.
///
/// This describes current values, never history. Decoding a ten-bit file does
/// not establish ten-bit evidence for RGB samples produced by a YCbCr matrix,
/// and resizing, filtering, color conversion or any mutable access ends it.
/// It is established only by the code that wrote the samples (for example an
/// exact widening of native codes), by an explicit sample scan
/// ([`measure`](Self::measure)), or by an operation that provably preserves it.
/// [`holds_for`](Self::holds_for) checks a statement against rows written
/// elsewhere, such as strips a row driver copied through a mutable view.
/// A statement built with [`new`](Self::new) and attached to a view is an
/// assertion; a consumer that relies on it should check the samples.
///
/// Exactness is defined for the canonical mapping only. A codec whose native
/// narrowing or reconstruction differs does not inherit it: truncating
/// canonical ten-bit level 577 gives code 9, which bit-replicated widening
/// returns as 576. Such a path needs its own qualification.
///
/// Higher depth is not automatically exact. Full-range N-bit grids nest only
/// when N divides the depth: canonical U16 samples holding eight-bit content
/// are exact at 8 and 16 bits but not at 10 or 12, where 252 and 240 of the 256
/// levels change. The original N-bit codes nevertheless remain recoverable at
/// every higher depth; [`color_codes_recoverable_at`](Self::color_codes_recoverable_at)
/// states that weaker guarantee.
