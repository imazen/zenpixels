//! Integer sample interpretation for native codec and video planes.
//!
//! Storage width, code depth and bit placement are independent. An unshifted
//! ten-bit code in a `u16` word is not a normalized sixteen-bit image sample.
//! This description does not change [`crate::PixelDescriptor`] or the existing
//! RGB/gray U16 numerical contract. A raw plane must retain this encoding with
//! its storage and obtain component roles, range and color from its enclosing
//! signal. Original source precision is separate provenance.
//!
//! Typed words use native endianness. A byte-backed adapter must decode its
//! declared byte order before applying the bit placement. Packed words holding
//! multiple components, signed integers and floating point are not described
//! by this one-unsigned-component-per-word representation.
